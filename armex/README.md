# armex

Track action that mimics the native Live functionality 'arm exclusive', which ClyphX Pro ignores (due to a limitation of the Live API).

Usage: `"my track" / ARMEX`

Similar to doing `ALL / ARM OFF; "my track" / ARM ON`, however doing this will momentarily un-arm the targeted track, which may cause issues with certain setups.
